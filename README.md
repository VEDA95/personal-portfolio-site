# Stefan's Corner Portfolio Website

This is the Github repository for me personal portfolio site. The repository only pertains to the frontend site. There is no repository for the backend as I am using [Directus](https://directus.io/) for this website. Further more the project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to ensure type safety.

The javascript libraries or libraries Used to build this site are:
- [Astro.JS](https://astro.build/)
- [React.JS](https://react.dev/)
- [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/)
- [React Three](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
- [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- [React Waypoint](https://github.com/civiccc/react-waypoint)

Beyond Javascript frameworks/libraries the website is styled using CSS styles provided by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
